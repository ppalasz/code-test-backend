1) Interfaces in the same files with classes (types not in matching files)
2) Missing separated folders for models, interfaces etc. (project structure!)
3) Code not clear because of no spaces, new lines etc. (style)
4) many IFs instead of SWITCH (bad mechanism of flow)
5) Bad variable names or declaration place and order (declarations)
6) Some confusing variable names, differ slightly from class names ("WebService" vs only "Service")
7) Test names suggest  "SelectiveInvoiceDiscount" when it passes object of type "ConfidentialInvoiceDiscount"
8) Missing tests for other products, missing scenarios with exception and other variants
8) Projects are in old frameworks versions.  I didn't update it since it wasn't specified as a task here.
